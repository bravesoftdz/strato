An attempt at a programming language without reserved words.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

I wanted to roll the muscle on writing an interpreter and perhaps a compiler (long shot). The main thing I try to get from this is appreciate more the work being done on the *serious* compilers and programming languages of this world.

Also I'm curious if it's at all doable and workable to have a programming language without any reserved words. If there's anything there and it grows from here, that would be nice but not at all what I'm after.
